# Change Log

## [0.4.10] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- Built-in recognition for `.db3`, `.s3db`, and `.sl3` databases, with case-insensitive matching for all supported SQLite extensions.
- `sqliteIntelliView.additionalFileExtensions` for recognizing custom SQLite filename extensions in commands and file pickers.

### Fixed

- Fixed a critical data-integrity bug where cell edits could update a different database row when grid position and SQLite scan order diverged after sorting, filtering, pagination, or virtual scrolling.
- Cell updates now use stable declared primary-key identities (including text and composite keys) or SQLite `rowid`, bind all values, and require exactly one changed row before reporting success.
- **Breaking:** Tables for which SQLite IntelliView cannot derive a stable row identity are now read-only instead of allowing potentially unsafe edits. Normal `rowid` tables remain editable. For tables whose SQLite `rowid` aliases are shadowed, define a non-null primary key to restore editing. Views remain read-only. Primary-key edits retain the original identity for the update and refresh it after saving.

## [0.4.9] - 2026-04-27

### Changed

- Refactored webview component styling to use shared SQLite/VS Code theme variables across sidebar, tables, tabs, buttons, notifications, dropdowns, dialogs, and diagrams.
- Updated the embedded Monaco SQL editor to dynamically follow VS Code theme changes.

### Fixed

- Improved text contrast in the sidebar table list and selected/hovered items across light, dark, and high-contrast themes.
- Replaced the query editor current-line red outline/background behavior with a subtle neutral highlight.

## [0.4.8] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- Removed debug launch configuration overrides from `.vscode/launch.json` (`preLaunchTask` and forced `PATH`) for the extension host launch config

## [0.4.7] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- Bundled cross-platform `sqlite3` CLI fallback binaries (Windows/macOS/Linux, x64/arm64) for WAL checkpoint support when no system `sqlite3` is on `PATH`
- New WAL/refresh settings: `sqliteIntelliView.walCheckpointMode` (`full`/`passive`/`off`) and `sqliteIntelliView.externalRefreshDebounceMs`
- Shared `src/webviewMessages.ts` message contracts and runtime guards for extension <-> webview messaging
- Webview settings payload (`defaultPageSize`, WAL settings, external refresh debounce) sent from the extension to support runtime UI behavior

### Changed

- WAL checkpointing now honors `walCheckpointMode` (and `walAutoCheckpoint` as a compatibility override) for `FULL`, `PASSIVE`, or disabled auto-checkpoint behavior
- WAL checkpoint CLI detection now prefers bundled `sqlite3` binaries and falls back to system `sqlite3`, with clearer warnings when no CLI is available
- External DB/WAL/SHM file watcher events now share a coalesced debounce window (configurable via `externalRefreshDebounceMs`) to reduce refresh storms
- Default table page size setting increased to `1000` (max increased to `100000`)
- Extension -> webview message sends in `databaseEditorProvider` now consistently use a typed helper for stronger payload shape checks during development
- README now documents WAL checkpoint mode, monitoring, and external refresh debounce settings

### Fixed

- Webview message validation now rejects malformed `updateCellData` messages missing `newValue` and `deleteRow` messages missing `rowId`
- `events.js` debug logging no longer throws if a received message cannot be `JSON.stringify`-ed (e.g., circular structures)
- Reduced noisy no-op “external change” notifications after WAL checkpoint/file-watcher bursts by deduping visible no-change delta notices

## [0.4.6] - 2026-01-29

### Added

- Warn when WAL files are detected but `sqlite3` is missing, to explain stale/empty data risk

### Changed

- SQLCipher decrypt/re-encrypt now uses cross-platform stdin execution instead of shell pipes

## [0.4.5] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed

- Only show per-cell scrollbars when content overflows (removes always-on black boxes)

## [0.4.4] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed

- Quote table names in schema/ER diagram PRAGMA calls so names with dots load correctly

## [0.4.3] - 2026-01-17

### Added

- 🔍 **Cell viewer dialog**: "Expand Cell" in the context menu opens a full-value viewer with copy for long text
- ↕ **Row expand/collapse**: Context menu action toggles multiline rows and persists row height per tab

### Changed

- 📐 **Table layout defaults**: Tables now derive width from default column sizes with multiline cell previews and scroll
- 🖱️ **Resizing UX**: Column/row resizing uses pointer events, auto-scroll near edges, and updates table width
- 🧰 **View state restores**: Column widths and row heights now refresh table width, multiline styling, and overflow indicators on load


## [0.4.2] - 2025-12-16

### Changed

- 🖼️ **Logo updated**: Replaced the extension icon/logo with a refreshed design (images/icon.png).

- ↕️ **Per-tab sort persistence**: Remembers client-side column sort (by column name) per table tab and restores it when switching tabs
- 🧾 **Clear empty states**: New “no results on this page” messaging for table page search/filters (virtualized and non-virtual tables)

### Changed

- 🧭 **Pagination event handling**: Pagination controls now use delegated listeners so regenerated pagination HTML continues to work without re-binding
- 🔎 **Search UX wording**: Table search placeholder clarifies it searches the current page
- 📄 **Bigger page size options**: Added very large page-size choices for browsing huge tables

### Fixed

- 📤 **Export correctness**: CSV export now ignores non-data rows (empty-state, virtual spacer/loading rows)

## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-13

### ⚡ Performance, UX, and Reliability Improvements

### Added

- ⚡ **Large table rendering performance**: Virtualized table rendering for large pages to keep the DOM small and scrolling/snapping responsive
- 💾 **Per-tab view state persistence**: Remembers page/page size, search term, scroll position, pinned columns, column widths, and row heights per tab
- ⌨️ **New keyboard shortcuts**:
  - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>: Refresh database view (re-fetch tables/data)
  - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>/<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>: Hard reload database connection (re-open from disk)
  - <kbd>/</kbd>: Focus table search (helpful when <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> is intercepted by VS Code)
- 🧠 **Smarter backend caching**: Row counts, table info, and foreign keys are cached, with async updates sent to the webview when available
- 🧾 **Readable JSON cell viewer**: Right-click JSON cells to `View JSON` in a formatted viewer and `Copy Formatted JSON`
- 🖼️ **BLOB viewer + image thumbnails**: Image blobs show a small thumbnail; right-click blobs to `View Image/View Blob` and copy as Base64/Hex (or download)

### Changed

- 🧩 **Schema loading is now lazy**: Table schema is requested only when the Schema tab is opened (reduces unnecessary work on Data tab)
- 🧱 **Table layout + resizing improvements**:
  - Tables can expand horizontally for column resizing (uses `<colgroup>` to apply widths efficiently)
  - Resizing and cell-editing handlers are delegated to reduce per-row/per-cell listeners
  - Cell rendering is truncated for very large values while preserving originals for editing
- 🧼 **Webview state is kept small**: Large/non-serializable caches are excluded from persisted state and persistence is debounced to avoid slow startups
- 🗃️ **Database open/connect behavior**:
  - `Open Database` now opens with the custom editor (`vscode.openWith`)
  - Encrypted database connect command better targets the active database editor and reconnects the open webview

### Fixed

- 🧷 **Virtualized table compatibility**: Copy column/copy table-as-JSON, export, sorting/filtering, and FK highlight now work when virtualization is enabled
- 🔐 **VS Code API guards**: Safer checks for `window.vscode.postMessage` across webview scripts to prevent runtime errors outside VS Code

## [0.2.14] - 2025-07-14

### Added

- Sidebar now automatically maximizes to show the encryption key input when an encrypted database fails to open and a key is required. This improves the user experience for SQLCipher-protected databases and makes key entry more discoverable.
- **Live Refresh:** The viewer now automatically refreshes table data and schema when the underlying database file changes externally. This includes:
  - Real-time detection of changes to the database file (using a file watcher in the extension backend).
  - Automatic refresh of the current table, schema, and tables list in the webview when a change is detected.
  - User notification when a refresh occurs due to an external change.
  - Pagination state is preserved across refreshes, and the UI updates without requiring a manual reload.
  - Improved global state management for pagination and table selection.
- Table view now supports live delta updates when the database file changes externally. The UI will show inserted, updated, and deleted rows in-place without a full reload.
- Table pinning/unpinning now visually resets all sticky styles for unpinned columns, improving accessibility and layout consistency.
- Table rowid is now always shown as '_rowid' in the data grid for clarity.
- Foreign key columns are more clearly indicated in the table header and cell rendering.

### Changed

- Table pagination and state are now managed globally, ensuring consistent navigation and data display after refreshes or table switches.
- Utility functions (such as `formatCellValue` and `showNotification`) are now available globally in the browser context for improved modularity and debugging.
- Improved event handling in the webview: event listeners are now guarded to prevent duplicate registration, and table event listeners are attached only once per table instance.
- Table pagination and search controls are more robust and accessible.
- Table data diffing is now performed in the extension backend, sending only the changed rows to the webview for efficient updates.
- Internal database writes (cell edits, deletes) are now ignored by the file watcher to prevent unnecessary reloads.

### Fixed

- Fixed issues with pagination controls not updating state correctly when changing page size or navigating pages.
- Fixed webview not always updating after an external database change.
- Fixed a bug where pinning/unpinning columns could leave stale sticky styles on headers or cells.
- Fixed a bug where the table would reload completely on every file change, instead of applying only the changed rows.
- Fixed duplicate 'id' column when both 'rowid' and 'id' are present and identical.
- Fixed table event listeners being attached multiple times to the same DOM elements.

## [0.2.13] - 2025-07-09

### 🛠️ Refactor: Modular CSS Architecture

- Migrated from a single monolithic CSS file (`media/vscode.css`) to a modular CSS architecture under `media/css/`.
  - Added new CSS files: `reset.css`, `00-variables.css`, `10-base.css`, `20-layout.css`, and all component-specific styles under `media/css/30-components/` (e.g., `buttons.css`, `modals.css`, `sidebar.css`, etc.).
  - Each UI component or area now has its own dedicated CSS file for improved maintainability and scalability.
  - **Removed:** The old `media/vscode.css` file has been deleted.
- Updated the webview HTML generation in `src/databaseEditorProvider.ts` to dynamically include all modular CSS files instead of referencing the old monolithic CSS file.
- This refactor improves code organization, makes it easier to update or extend styles, and reduces the risk of CSS conflicts.

## [0.2.12] - 2025-07-07

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where the data tab would open with 1000 results instead of the intended 100.
- Removed duplicate inline table statistics from the Data tab (cleaned up both JavaScript logic and CSS styling).
- Fixed issue where the active tab would automatically switch to the schema tab when selecting a table in the sidebar. Now, the tab remains unchanged and only the data/schema refreshes.
